# Grade service center

## Introduction 

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy looking at statistics and data, and always feel the 
UBC student service centre to be lacking in this department. The SSC provides the students with only a mean average 
grade and final grade for their course, with no information on the actual grade distribution or assignment results for 
the student and even the professor to reflect on the course.

This application allows for **students** and **professors** to record more detailed information about course results 
such as assignment scores and their breakdowns, and then process and present these in a more meaningful 
way in the portal.

## User stories     

- As a user, I want to be able to login with a professor id and password and load my data
- As a user, I want to be able to login with a student id and password and load my data
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account with either a professor or student id and password
- As a user, I want to be able to quit out of the application and have my changes saved if selected
