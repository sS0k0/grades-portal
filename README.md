# Grade service center

## Introduction 

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy looking at statistics and data, and always feel the 
UBC student service centre to be lacking in this department. The SSC provides the students with only a mean average 
grade and final grade for their course, with no information on the actual grade distribution or assignment results for 
the student and even the professor to reflect on the course.

This application allows for **students** and **professors** to record more detailed information about course results 
such as assignment scores and their breakdowns, and then process and present these in a more meaningful 
way in the portal.

- As a user, I want to be able to create an account with either a professor or student id and password
